# Software Development for Data Science Coursework

## Project Overview

This repository contains the coursework for the Software Development for Data Science module at Glasgow Caledonian University. The project focuses on exploring the applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in deep learning.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of deep learning and its subfield, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It discusses the different types of neural network architectures, including CNNs, recurrent neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons. The focus of the project is on CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification, object detection, and related tasks.

## Key Concepts

- **Deep Learning:** A subfield of machine learning that utilizes complex architectural structures with multiple layers for feature extraction, pattern analysis, and classification.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A type of deep neural network specifically designed for image-related tasks, leveraging convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and discover patterns.
- **Neural Network Architectures:** Different types of neural networks, each with its own strengths and applications.

## Project Structure

- **Chapter 1: Introduction:** Provides background information on deep learning and CNNs.
- **[Subsequent Chapters]:** Explore specific aspects of CNNs and their applications.
